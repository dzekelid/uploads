apis:
- name: Dropbox Content API v1 - Uploads large files to Dropbox in multiple chunks.
  x-api-slug: chunked-upload-put
  description: |-
    Uploads large files to Dropbox in multiple chunks. Also has the ability to resume if the upload is interrupted.
    This allows for uploads larger than the `/files_put` maximum of 150 MB.

    Typical usage:
      1. Send a PUT request to `/chunked_upload` with the first chunk of the file without setting `upload_id`, and
      receive an `upload_id` in return.
      2. Repeatedly `PUT` subsequent chunks using the `upload_id` to identify the upload in progress and an `offset`
      representing the number of bytes transferred so far.
      3. After each chunk has been uploaded, the server returns a new offset representing the total amount transferred.
      4. After the last chunk, `POST` to `/commit_chunked_upload` to complete the upload.

    Chunks can be any size up to 150 MB. A typical chunk is 4 MB. Using large chunks will mean fewer calls
    to `/chunked_upload` and faster overall throughput. However, whenever a transfer is interrupted, you will
    have to resume at the beginning of the last chunk, so it is often safer to use smaller chunks.

    If the offset you submit does not match the expected offset on the server, the server will ignore the request
    and respond with a 400 error that includes the current offset. To resume upload, seek to the correct offset
    (in bytes) within the file and then resume uploading from that point.

    A chunked upload can take a maximum of 48 hours before expiring.

  description: |-
    Completes an upload initiated by the `/chunked_upload` method. Saves a file uploaded via `/chunked_upload` to
    a user's Dropbox.

    `/commit_chunked_upload` is similar to `/files_put`. The main difference is that while `/files_put` takes the
    file contents in the request body, `/commit_chunked_upload` takes a parameter `upload_id`, which is obtained
    when the file contents are uploaded via `/chunked_upload`.
