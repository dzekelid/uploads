description: 'API allowing retailers to manage their product feed content programmatically.
  Providing item-level data quality information: See if an item was disapproved because
  a landing page URL isn&rsquo;t working on a mobile device or if unique product identifiers
  are inaccurate. Faster pricing and availability updates: Ensure customers have the
  latest price-points and know what&rsquo;s in-stock before they click through to
  your site. More integration options: The newer API supports a broader choice of
  programming languages and data formats.'
